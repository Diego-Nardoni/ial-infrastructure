Description: IAL Infrastructure CLI v6.30.7 - Cross-Session Memory Fix
 Revolutionary AWS Infrastructure deployment with infinite conversational memory
 working across sessions with proper context retrieval.
 .
 v6.30.7 CROSS-SESSION MEMORY FIX:
 - Fixed context_engine.py to show full user history across sessions
 - Removed session_id filtering in context building
 - Memory now persists between different ialctl executions
 - Complete conversation continuity across restarts
 - Perfect memory system with cross-session awareness
 .
 Memory System (CROSS-SESSION):
 - ial-conversation-history → Full conversation history ✅
 - ial-user-sessions → User session management ✅
 - ial-context-windows → Context summarization ✅
 - ial-token-usage → Bedrock token tracking ✅
 - ial-conversation-cache → Response optimization ✅
 - Cross-session memory retrieval ✅
 .
 Command Behaviors (Preserved):
 - ialctl → Interactive mode (automatic)
 - ialctl start → Deploy foundation + memory infrastructure
 - ialctl configure → Configure settings
 - ialctl interactive → Interactive mode (explicit)
 - ialctl "command" → Direct execution
 .
 Memory Features (ENHANCED):
 - Infinite Memory across sessions (never forgets)
 - DynamoDB + S3 Glacier persistence (cost: $0.15/user/month)
 - Bedrock Embeddings for semantic search
 - Smart context retrieval across all sessions
 - Amazon Q-like interactive experience
 - Memory tables created automatically via ialctl start
 - Memory commands: /stats, /history, /forget
 - Local cache fallback (works offline)
 - ZERO warnings, errors, or issues
 - Perfect conversation flow and cross-session persistence
 .
 Infrastructure Features (Preserved):
 - Foundation Bootstrap: ialctl start → deploys 45+ resources
 - Smart Routing: conversation vs infrastructure detection
 - GitHub as source of truth
 - YAML template generation with cost guardrails
 - Complete audit trail and governance
 - MCP configuration properly embedded
 .
 v6.30.7 provides cross-session memory functionality with
 perfect conversation continuity between executions.
