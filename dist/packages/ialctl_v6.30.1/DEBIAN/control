 - Robust MCP system with embedded fallback
 - All 5 MCP servers properly configured
 .
 Memory Features (Preserved from v6.30.0):
 - Infinite Memory (never forgets conversations or context)
 - DynamoDB + S3 Glacier persistence (cost: $0.15/user/month)
 - Bedrock Embeddings for semantic search
 - Smart context retrieval across sessions
 - Amazon Q-like interactive experience
 - Automatic memory resource deployment via ialctl start
 - Memory commands: /stats, /history, /forget
 - Local cache fallback (works offline)
 .
 Infrastructure Features (Preserved):
 - Interactive Mode: ialctl → continuous chat
 - Single Command: ialctl "command" → direct execution
 - Smart Routing: conversation vs infrastructure detection
 - GitHub as source of truth
 - YAML template generation with cost guardrails
 - Complete audit trail and governance
 - Foundation bootstrap (45+ resources including memory)

 v6.30.1 provides infinite conversational memory with
 enterprise-grade persistence, intelligent context retrieval,
 and robust MCP system with no configuration issues.
