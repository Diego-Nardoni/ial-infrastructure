Description: Infrastructure Assistant Layer Control - PHASE DETECTION System v3.19.0
 IAL Control with INTELLIGENT PHASE DETECTION and management
 .
 🎯 PHASE DETECTION FEATURES v3.19.0:
 - Intelligent phase detection for existing phases
 - Smart suggestions for phase management
 - Prevention of duplicate workload creation
 - Guidance for new phase creation
 - Complete phase lifecycle management
 .
 🚀 PHASE MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS:
 ✅ Phase Detection: Recognizes existing phases (10 phases scanned)
 ✅ Smart Suggestions: "ialctl deploy 20-network" for existing phases
 ✅ Duplicate Prevention: No more workload creation for existing phases
 ✅ New Phase Guidance: Options for creating new phases
 ✅ Help Integration: Complete phase commands in --help
 .
 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
 - PhaseDetector class with intelligent scanning
 - Pattern matching for phase intents
 - Integration with Intelligent MCP Router
 - Status handling for phase_exists, similar_phases_found, new_phase_detected
 - Comprehensive phase suggestions formatting
 .
 💡 PHASE COMMANDS AVAILABLE:
 - ialctl list-phases: List all available phases
 - ialctl deploy <phase>: Deploy specific phase
 - ialctl delete <phase>: Delete specific phase
 - Interactive: "criar phase X" with intelligent detection
 .
 🎯 BEHAVIOR EXAMPLES:
 - "criar phase 20-network" → Detects existing, suggests deploy
 - "criar phase 25-monitoring" → Detects new, offers creation options
 - "phase 10-security" → Shows existing phase details and options
 - Smart prevention of duplicate infrastructure creation
 .
